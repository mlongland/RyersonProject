Very thick, rocky, stable, clearly hops-enhanced, thickly lacing, snow white head over a light hazy, beautifully pale yellow blonde beer. Wonderfully fragrant aroma of lemon peel, chamomille, orange peel, white pepper, pine needles, lavender, white bread, passionfruit, white grapes, old cheese, pear. Vivid, fruity but 'clean' onset, melon, pineapple, pear, creamy mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation, sweetish bready and lightly honeyish maltiness, slightly yeasty, dry finish, complexely hoppy, floral, bit citrussy, bit piney with some of the exotic fruitiness coming through. Saisons pop up everywhere these days and are not necessarily dry-hopped, but I can accept this one as a very refined example of the style. Great beer. "

Granted, the Galaxy didn't taste all that much different from the previous two, but what it did lack was that big cotton candy, aspartame-like sweetness mixed with too much punchy sweet tart-like candied fruitiness. The aroma was still a mixed bag for me (and my friend who had some), with some raw yeastiness and very inelegant esters (canned peach, spoiling apricot). Light citrus and mango somewhat elevate but it still seems too messy. No alcohol in the nose, at least. The flavor, for whatever reason, is MUCH cleaner than the others. Instead of the cotton candy and sweet tarts, It's a more dry, hop centered strong ale-like flavor. Not overly Belgian, again, but the hops are done well, adding moderate bitterness but no resin (mangoes, starfruit, cherries, oranges). Carbonation is a little tighter, or perhaps it just feels so, having less yeast and/or hop particle slickness in the mouthfeel. So, more of just a strong, hoppy pale ale here. Definitely not rating this as a super saison, even, on which, it would score much worse. Either this is a second batch fermented a bit longer/lower temps, or (likely) this one just had more time to condition before its release. The beer looked in better condition, as well, having only a light haziness to its soft copper-tangerine juice color. White head was large and slowly receded to cover. "

All the IPA flavors I would expect are there- citrus, pine and tropical notes but balance is off. Too much earthiness (not the good kind) and vegetal notes. Maybe weird notes from different malts?

PX barrel this time. Black with a scant coat of tan head. Fudgy mocha aroma with some char and a little smoke, prunes, peppery oak. Low carbonation, rather lighter body than you might expect (hmm). There's mocha and roasted flavours but the vinous and fruity things more than hold their own. The peat is not domineering but comes through fairly strongly at the woody and slightly astringent end. Interesting. Would have liked more stout and less peat and barrel. "

The taste was mainly sweet through the floral and the honey adding a bit of grassiness underneath. There's no aftertaste but a light sweet floral finish.

Fortunately whatever bugs are in here have left quite drinkable brew. Almost, but not quite, refreshing - the dryness of the yeast is a bit dirty and earthy. Does cover the 6% fairly well, though. At least It's not a cookie-cutter saison, but It's a cookie-cutter gone-sour beer. Good brewers managed to work out how to stop their beers going sour. Brave to fight against that trend. Some succeed, some don't. Ug, second pour more lemony, more refreshing aroma, but taste is just shitty lemon juice. Fuck that, I've thrown away homebrews like this. "

Alcohol melds well with the beer and is not anything to fight about. The waitress said this was 6.2% ABV this year. Flavors are crisp, clean and bright, but not anything too special.

Colored the bright gold of a piece of bullion, the brew's topped with a head of snowy white froth that quickly evaporates. Dip the nose near that fluff and you'll find an aroma that's at once sweet and resinous, as if you smushed a hop in a juicer. Floral honey, blades of grass, lemon-lime, and honeydew are all noticeable. Sarcosuchus was a 10-ton super-croc, a massive yet ultimately unsustainable version of another beast. Many imperial IPAs attempt to replicate his enormity with over-the-top bitterness or colossal citrus flavor and are remembered as he is: badass at the time, but, in the end, dead. The greatness of Dragoon's double IPA comes not from exaggerated flavors, but rather from the unique seasoning the hops are able to provide and the cleanliness with which they're delivered to the tongue. Blueberry, pear, green grape, vodka, wet grass, grapefruit pith, sticky icky weed -- all can be found within the viscous, medium-light-bodied liquid. A very berry-fruit hop character punctuated by ethanol reminds me of the blueberry vodka that gave me so many hangovers as a young'n. Bitterness is pretty mild for a beer of this much hop character, as is sweetness. The flavor of alcohol is just a bit too pronounced but is balanced somewhat by a dry, Chardonnay-like quality that becomes even more intense as the beer warms. Despite the booziness -- this is a 21-proof beer, after all -- Sarcosuchus is deceptively easy to drink. "

Dried and some candied fruits in the onset, dates, raisins and blackcurrant, sharpish minerally carbonation (overcarbonated for this style), sourish and sweetish flavours in balance with each other, making room for a deep, thick, caramelly and nutty maltiness adorned by spicy yeastiness, but perhaps a bit less 'oily' and fat than I am used to from this style; towards the end, a fairly strong and fondant chocolate-like roasted bitterness sets in, long-lasting and accompanied by a sharper, leafy hops bitterness as well as a warming, but in all very bearable, 'jenever'- or wodka-like alcohol presence and lingering carbonation; the last impressions are a tingling carbo sensation, oily maltiness, residual sourishness, warming alcohol (though not obnoxious at all) and a mouth-filling, roasted and lightly peppery hoppy bitterness. Not bad at all, but it does feel very 'Belgian', a tad too sour in nose and mouth, and for an imperial stout I also find this overcarbonated (point off on palate for that). The ABV is very impressive and in all very well hidden, at least in the taste (not so much in the effect this has on the head), but unnecessary; it is the third time I feel this brewery is trying to impress us with 'big' beers but this could function equally well - or perhaps better - at, say, 9 or 10% ABV. Still recommended though, but handle with care. I blame myself for being too impatient with this: I bet this ages very well, and by losing some of the carbonation over a five years period, it probably only becomes better, especially since the sourish component may act as a preservative. I do like these guys' labels: if the beer is meant to be dark, the arty labels aptly illustrate that. Pondering about this, I'd call this 'the Raven' rather than 'the Crow', as the raven is considerably bigger (but not necessarily darker) than the black crow... Perhaps there is a 17% ABV version of this coming up under that name? "

Pours near pitch black with a huge, dense, thick creamy head - it does disappear after a long while. On the nose It's roasty and peppery, some soy notes, liqorice, wood, peat. Kinda salty. The pepper fades later on, giving way to a more traditional, thick and vinous Impy character. Tastes extremely nice - deep roast together with not overpowering bitter chocolate sweetness, then in the second wave some hoppiness and woody notes. Burnt wood. Cedar and juniper. The peppery character is just enough to give off a nice warm sensation while not disorienting the well crafted Stout that this is. Body medium plus, soft and velvety in the mouth, with near flat carbonation. Leaves the roof of the mouth somewhat dry, even ashy. Alcohol well covered. Complex and memorable. Excellent!

Obsidian, with the only off-shade at the very top of the brew. Tan, foamy cap settles at a quarter-inch & lasts for a little while. Aroma is syrupy blueberry, light residual sugar, milky & sweet cream, light oak, & a solid nutty presence. Not detecting any bourbon in the aroma. Blueberries are more tame on the palate, still coming up sweet & fragrant but not as syrupy or artificial as I imagined they might be. Barrel presence is also larger; light whiskey, oak, warm vanilla. With some time/warmth, this beer goes from 'more boozy, less sweet' to 'more sweet, less boozy'... End of the glass resembles a dessert beer. Sweet blueberry, light chocolate malt, vanilla, oak, even a slight hint of tartness.

Not a lot of fruitiness on the nose at all, more so the booze and the bourbon effect, but the blueberry flavor is hinted at, without the floral aspects that berries often lend. So big - cream, followed by bitter chocolate, followed by bourbon finished with blueberries. A tad thin in viscosity, but not detrimentally considered the APV, and warming accordingly. Overall: Bourbon soaked blueberries in a batch of perfectly-creamed impy stout. Almost a sour because of the lactic presence, but plenty of cream to balance it. Frankly, I don't favor cream stouts, but this is my full-tilt my favorite."

Clarity was medium-high with a chocolate brown color and dark maroon-garnet tints on the edges. Vinous nose has both prunes and plums from dark malt but also tartness from wild yeast. Definitely (at least partly) a lactic infection, which has kicked out some nice acidity. It nestles in right next to the lovely chocolate and dry roastiness while smoother pale malt sugars, no doubt rather thinned out by this point and some soothing vanilla notes help lightly buffer the tartness. Cherries and raisins quite succulently ooze forth on the finish as well, with light cola and caramel suggestions. Very complex, and despite the lactic notes, still manages some softness. Pretty minimally phenolic, at least considering the unplanned infection and with no tacky oxidation or soy-like flavors, nor any dull ashiness. Still quite a strong nose, with little/no alcohol apparency. A hint of light chocolate cake quickly mixes with some lighter cola-like notes and prunes and plums and raisins quickly emerge. Strong chocolate and creamy vanilla base of sweetness is slowly eroded as the beer continues and finishes, ending moderately tart, quite dry and with only a medium amount of chocolate malt roastiness. The lactic notes are not overpowering, however, though they are definitely an integral part of the beer. Very well attenuated, moreso than intended, of course, but I love it. Very dry and tart, but with enough chocolate, vanilla, roast and vinousness to define the beer as an Imperial Stout. Carbonation does not last very long, but because of the dryness, the resulting concentration of flavors does not cloy or overpower. Alcohol is well-concealed. Lighthearted cherry-chocolate-vanilla cola with lactic notes and dry roast. Can't beat that combo. No doubt a bit tired now, but It's easy to see how incredibly brilliant this must have been a couple of years ago and that is more where my score is coming from. Interested to try the new batch, but I'll probably keep the score from this batch, since I enjoyed the lactic aspect so much. Thanks so much for opening this, Chris! "

This rendition of a Russian Imperial Stout is also infused with a blend of Mexican and Ethiopian fair-trade organic coffee. Complex and contemplative, and with well-integrated alcohol warmth, The Bottle Imp is best served in a snifter, sipped slowly and savoured. History & Style Beau's Pro-Am Series is a salute to homebrewers, true innovators of our craft. These beers are designed by amateur brewers, and brewed at Beau's. The Bottle Imp was brewed in collaboration with David Thompson, winner of the 2012 Toronto Beer Week Homebrew Contest. The Russian Imperial Stout style is brewed to weigh in high on alcohol, with the roasted, malty character typical of a stout. The style was first brewed in England in the 18th century, and exported to Russia for the pleasure of Czarina Catherine II and her court. The Bottle Imp is a haunting turn-of-the-century tale by Robert Louis Stevenson about risking eternal damnation of the soul to have everything on earth one's heart desires. We suggest pairing the beer and the story on a cold night by a crackling fire. Tasting Notes The Bottle Imp is black, rich and malty, with a mouthfeel best described as liquid silk. The roasty dark malt character is complemented by fruit notes that suggest dates and figs, as well as subtle notes of black licorice. It is well-hopped to provide balance to the malts, keeping the residual sweetness in check. The coffee character is fully integrated, and a complement to the roast of the malts. The experience is rich and intense, with gentle alcohol warmth, and a long, complex finish.

The Russian Imperial Stout style is brewed to weigh in high on alcohol, with the roasted, malty character typical of a stout. The style was first brewed in England in the 18th century, and exported to Russia for the pleasure of Czarina Catherine II and her court. The Bottle Imp is a haunting turn-of-the-century tale by Robert Louis Stevenson about risking eternal damnation of the soul to have everything on earth one's heart desires. We suggest pairing the beer and the story on a cold night by a crackling fire. Tasting Notes The Bottle Imp is black, rich and malty, with a mouthfeel best described as liquid silk. The roasty dark malt character is complemented by fruit notes that suggest dates and figs, as well as subtle notes of black licorice. It is well-hopped to provide balance to the malts, keeping the residual sweetness in check. The coffee character is fully integrated, and a complement to the roast of the malts. The experience is rich and intense, with gentle alcohol warmth, and a long, complex finish. The coffee infused into The Bottle Imp are a Mexican dark roast from Chiapas region (chocolate malt, toasted spice flavours) and a medium-roast Ethiopian Yirgacheffe (floral, berries, tropical fruit flavours), both roasted by Bridgehead in Ottawa.  Food Pairings Pumpernickel bread, trifle, dark chocolate fondue, coffee cake, grilled steak, truffle-oil-infused mashed potatoes, & sharp cheddar or stilton.

A blast in the face aroma of dark roasted coffee, soy, sweet cocoa nibs, maple syrup, and a sprinkle of green, pine resins. I cant get my nose out of the glass. Im in love. Medium. Outh feel, a touch viscous, and a soft carb. The alcohol is well hidden, the finish is medium to high in bitterness. The finish is intensly roasted, and there is a huge amount of dry roasted coffee grounds in the finish, touches of vanilla and grass linger. This is my favorite beaus beer "

Not sure I'd call this a saison (It's almost a wit, to me) but It's pretty darn tasty nonetheless. "

Nice fruity aroma along with light hops, spices, herbs and grain -- not quite on style but It's lovely. Flavour's not super Saison-ey but It's very good regardless: Fruity, a touch dry, lightly hoppy and some spices in the finish. Gets a touch sweet after a while but not overly so. Average to medium bodied. Again, not quite on style but It's a great beer. "

The nose is bright and enticing and most flavors come from the hop selection. -Cereal flavors are playing second fiddle, but could still be better defined. -Drinkability is high, but you need to be accustomed to generous hop resins in the finish. -The fruity onslaught is complex from nose to finish.

The grinning celestial body could join the pantheon of adorable Japanese mascots, but here instead of sponsoring a prefecture or a beauty cream, the sun is beaming about the Helios brew. True to its label, Helios is a sunny yellow brew, which lights up like a bulb when a ray of sunlight strikes it. A dip of the nose reveals light grape notes, a splash of white vinegar, some creamy Swiss cheese, and a perfumed puff of honeysuckle. It's a spritz smell, with a nice collection of outdoor, Springy scents. The palate, like the aroma, is trafficked with plenty of bubbles and carbonation, but it calms quickly halfway through the taste, pulling back the curtain and flavors of apple and pear. and a curious taste of live in the aftertaste.

S - Smells of strong kumquat fruitiness, very light spice, but of musty funk, dash of earthy mineral and some doughy pale malt. T - Starts off with a quick hit of peppery spice quickly being enveloped by the strong kumquat fruitiness, mild funk, damp earth and some chewy pale malt. Finish is pretty dry, lingering long after the finish. M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Fruity, funky feel with a good amount of dryness backing it up.

American crystal malts provide light toast and caramel notes along with the beer's rich amber hue, while Munich malt supplies Tarnation's malty body. The complex malt notes balance the ample bitterness of American Northern Brewer hops (the signature hop for this style) giving the beer great balance. An authentic San Francisco lager yeast ferments the brew, yielding a clean, crisp and satisfying beer. This lager requires several weeks of cold conditioning ('lagering'), but we think It's worth the wait."	40.000	""	3.150	159.000	5.300	""	"3.5"	6.000	3.000	7.000	4.000	15.000	"MrMeadMan"	"Amesbury, Massachusetts, USA "	"FEB 24, 2015"	"Not a bad brew!

Dark copper, quite clear, no head at all. Lots of alchool legs, though. Boozy and slightly harsh nose, but I'm not a huge fan of certain aromas. Dark fruits, burnt caramel, molasses and some baked apples reminiscence. Completely different, in a great way, taste wise. Thick and sirupy without being cloying at all. Rich and addicting malt sweetness, lovely fruity edge, ridicolous drinkability considering the ABV. Flat carbonation, medium to full body, oily texture. Probably a 4.5+ beer if I were a fan of boozy beers. Still superb! "

This deep, soil red's aroma is powerful and rich, sweet and smooth, and hits the nose with a red wine vinegar sourness that suggests some effort was made to pin coffee bitterness with red wine acidity. The flavor is husky, bold, and savory. A long aftertaste produces a commanding hickory and raspberry mocha flavor, and adds a pine stickiness to the aftertaste without adding the happiness I anticipate when pine flavors are abundant. Motes of coffee flavors float around, but there's a well researched balance that prevents this beer from becoming a monomaniacal beer-coffee hybrid monster. "

Appearance: Black with a medium dark brown head and some lacing. Aroma: A burst (!) of coffee with rich maple syrup, chocolate and vanilla notes. Taste: Strong rich expressive coffee presence (never vegetal) along a massive maple syrup presence that makes the beer quite sweet, but the coffee is so strong that the impression of sweetness isn't too much and It's kind of well balanced. Super rich. There's also chocolate, caramel and vanilla notes. Palate: Full bodied. Moderate carbonation. Silky mouthfeel. Roasty finish with very little coffee bitterness and a lengthy maple syrup and coffee aftertaste. Overall: Wow! I think I never had a beer with that much coffee (and no vegetal) presence... and It's still well balanced. Rich and tasty. One of my favorite beer of EBF and so much better than Founders CBS that is also of maple syrup/coffee stout and that I also tried (for the 2nd time) at EBF. Great RIS. "

It's floral and orange citrusy, but there's a non-malty sweetness there that's hard to place. Just smells slightly sweet in a very light way. There's also a hint of an after-smell that reminds me of my homebrew IPA that I could never quite place. Not as hop-forward as the smell. It has more bittering hops than aromatic hops, it seems. The bitterness comes even before the maltiness. The malt just barely peeks through and then fades to a lingering bitterness. Again, there is that strange homebrew flavor that I still can't place. Medium heavy body, but not too boozy or sweet. A little creamy. Well made, if a little underwhelming. "

The appearance has a golden amber colored body that is slightly transparent with a thin half finger white foamy head that dies immediately leaving some speckled spider web lacing clinging pretty hard to the glass. The smell has biscuit/cracker malt-like subtleties coated over top of the hops - basically combined nicely with a tropical yet slightly citrusy sort of hops. The taste is bittersweet as its nicely combined all the way throughout the entire drink. It has a bittersweet aftertaste with a dry sticky finish. On the palate, she sits about a medium, comes across semi-sessionable, and has a carbonation that is good for a DIPA as there is nothing obscure and still gives an adequate sharpness most DIPA's give, surprisingly enough, ABV isn't really noticed. Overall, this is a very good DIPA that I would have again. "

Thanks, Art! The pour is a golden color with a thin, mostly short-lived, fizzy white head. The aroma is nice; pretty much like any typical good Hefeweizen: wheat, clove, banana, and some spice. The flavors follow; a soft wheat and herbal character kicks things off, lavender comes to mind, with banana, a little orange spice, light cinnamon, sweet vanilla, and a stale grain finish. Zippy carbonation that tingles the palate. Refreshing, easy going, and pretty tasty stuff. Definitely a winner in the middle of a Florida summer. "

The flavor is very spicy, with light residual sugars, strong bitterness, late hop resins and some citrusy/orange bitterness. Good. "

Nose: very mild (the age?) feel of citrusy hops, grapefruit basically, a hint of honey. Mouth: not much to report (sadly), only some residual bitterness. It stays decent but I assume it was far better when bottled. My rating refers to this beer 15 months old then. "

Poured a clear medium yellow with a 1' inch foam head that settled to a skim after a few minutes. Some lacing noted. Aroma was lightly grainy and crackers, followed by earthy notes, with an almost stale cardboard aroma. I did't pick up any citrus, pine, or dank type aromas. Medium body with normal for style carbonation. Flavor was similar to saltine crackers with some very light grapefruit hop flavor, I found this beer to be crisp with little sweetness. Medium for style bitterness at the end. Again, I tasted a little 'cardboard' like flavor. Overall, I found this IPA to be at the lower end of better American west coast style IPAs. I think if this was brewed with Pilsner yeast as a lager, it would tasted more like a nice hoppy Pilsner."

A short, sticky white head is lacing the glass and leaving a thin film atop the beer. Aroma is hard to nail down but there is some hop stickiness there. Taste is similar to the regular IPA but hoppier with a decently bitter finish and bitter lemon flavor, minimal malt breadiness. The carbonation is healthy and active so the mouthfeel is a little bubbly. This is a good IPA, they should change the recipe of the regular IPA to this.

Heavy grapefruit citrus flavors. This is really delicious. My guess is that it might well have been undrinkable at first bottling, but the year and a half or so in the cellar has made this something that is totally prime and ready to drink right now.

Looks: Cloudy hazy golden orange colour with no yeast sediments; One-quarter finger head and soapy white foam which fades in 20 seconds; Very good sticky lacing with near zero carbonation. Aroma: Fragrant Ale malt, with floral, light passion fruits, orange, strong marmalade, honey, very light pine, thin lemon and thin grass. Taste: Close to light sweet Ale malt, with strong citrus peels, light grapefruits, strong tartness, light molasses notes, strong earth, pine, dry biscuits, yeast, strong lemon, strong bitter hops and sharp grass. Body: Medium body. Thick, slick and creamy palate. Mouth Feel: Good Ale maltyness in a thick and creamy body, despite the presence of wheat and strong tartness. Hops are overwhelming peels of grapefruits and lemons, very fruity astringent, sharp but not very fresh. Very subdued sweetness, strong earthy taste. Pretty good. Hoppiness: strong jammy orange, floral, light passion fruits, honey, very light pine, in nose. Strong citrus peels, earth, light pine, strong lemon and grass in taste. Bitterness is strong, more in a fruity sense for a lasting, strong astringent fruity malty finish. After Taste: Dry. Hoppy and fruity-bitter to mouth. Comments: I suppose this is one of SN's experimental brew which is good enough to be lumped into variety pack but risky as a mass-produced goods. It shows: The hops are geared towards citrus peels taste, so much so it overpowers the nice marmalade aroma but not refreshing. Perfectly drinkable but not what I expected from SN's refreshing hoppiness. "

Highly carbonated upfront with a frothy foamy mouthfeel and relatively light body. Dusty, grainy malt on the tip. Herbal and floral from there on in but it seems more the stems than the leaves.

Tastes intensely resinous, blank bark and quince peel coated in both exotic fruit derived and more sirupy caramels. Overall a typically in-your-face, tasty Mikkeller IPA, hop-engineered on the highest level, but without that extra touch to make it a memorable drinking experience or add some extra-testtube character. - Add to that the '3,99 Braufactum cooler ransom in Germany and you have yourself a gentrified one-off at 150-200% the price of some of the better imported US IPAs.

The aroma was floral, though not as floral as I would have expected, and I got to candy/chewing gum from it, but then in the flavor I got huge orange and grapefruit notes, hanging on for ever. Bitterness, but not too much bitterness. More orange and grapefruit at the end. Really enjoyable IPA if you like an IPA. Tap at brewpub. "

This bright sunray yellow ale has a unique dried papaya, coconut and lemongrass nose with a silky smooth light mouthfeel from the addition of Chinese rice. Take a sip and transcend to the streets of Shanghai."	13.000	3.690	3.520	189.000	6.300	24.000	"4"	8.000	4.000	8.000	4.000	16.000	"JCB"	"Durham, North Carolina, USA "	"MAY 20, 2013"	"Thanks, Bob! Growler shared with my sis, and we both loved the tea-liciousness of it. Vibrant gold elixir for sure, cloudy but jewels within. Nice fluffy head, elegant lacing. Certainly seems that there is a really fine, quite dry and spicy saison at work here before the additions of the tea. Dry, a bit bitter, and invitingly herbal. Tea notes in the nose are certainly prominent, but promise careful integration. This is definitely true, as the appealing spicy and yeasty qualities of the saison make for a nice home for the tea, even as they're transformed by it. Excellent stuff."

Intense and original. Excellent. How: Tap at brewpub The look: Cloudy blonde body topped by a medium white head In long: The nose is very rustic (borderline funky) with fruits and a flower bouquet. Taste packs a lot of crisp cereals, a lot of tart fruits (white grapes, pineapples, etc.) and lots of lemon skin. The beer is also full of flowers, dandelions comes to mind but the flower taste is more complex than that. I just don't eat flowers on a regular basis so I don't know. A lot of flowers anyway. Herbs and grass too. The rustic level is very high, almost bretty. The tartness is rather commanding and makes it a beer to drink slowly. I could have done without the light white grape sourness but overall this is quite a creation. I thought it was excellent and my girlfriend (another Saison freak) liked it even more than I and thought it was one of the best beer she ever had. Once in a while I find my girlfriend has good taste. These instances and rare and far between but they nonetheless make me feel better about myself. "

The head fades relatively slowly leaving a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell ' The aroma of the beer is big of chocolate and roast with a strong showing of a yeasty and funky smell. Along with these aromas comes notes of grass and a little bit of caramel and hay. Taste ' The taste begins with a nice blend of a citrus orange flavor mixed with flavors of chocolate and caramel. The sweeter flavors start out stronger, with them fading as the taste moves on further to the end. All the while a yeasty and funky taste get stronger in nature with both becoming more potent to the end of the taste. Along with these flavors some hay and grass, and with the chocolate and caramel fading a bit but still remaining rather strong, one is left with a somewhat sweeter funked almost brownie like flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel- The beer is on the slightly thicker and chewier side with a carbonation level that is rather low. For the saison style a little more carbonation may have been nice, but even with that said, the feel was rather nice and made for a nice sipping brew. Overall ' This was a nice dark saison in my opinion. It blended an almost porter like flavor with a season flavor to create an interesting and flavorful taste overall. "

T: Although I wasn't as huge a fan of the aroma as the other guys, I'm even less impressed with the taste. The flavor just isn't doing it for me. Hop and citrus notes seem muted and blurred by alcohol intensity. In addition, the beer is just too sweet. Overall, it was out of balance and just not that impressive. M: Under carbonated and too sweet. Could be much better. D: A small serving of this was more than enough. Unless the next batch of this is drastically different, this was my first and last rendezvous with Dank Tank Border Hopper. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 12-04-201 "

Translucent amber honey colour with slight trace of dirt-like yeast sediments; One finger head and off-white foam which lasts about 1 minute; Excellent sticky lacing with near zero carbonation; Sweet aroma of ale malt, with very pungent grass but not skunky. Also sharp grapefruit zest, orange, honey, sugar, light floral, yeast, bread, dry biscuits and lemon; Nice sweet taste of ale malt, with grapefruit, strong molasses, pine, strong resin, yeast, very dry biscuits, earth, light spices, lemon, lime, and very sharp and bitter grassy hops; Mid to full body. Very dry, slick and oozy palate; Mouth feel is throwback IPA-style - quite wholesome body, very dry and biscuit, good citrus flavor, nice sweetness and comfy booze to counter the very hoppy and razor-sharp and bitter grass. Quite a treat!... Hoppiness is bright grapefruit zest, light floral and smelly grass nose (maybe slightly light-struck), good citrus, pine, oozy resin, strong lemon and lime plus shiny grassy hops in taste. Very sharp and tasty bitterness for very lasting and licking astringent finish. Very nice! Very dry after taste, very hoppy and bitter to mouth. Comment: After the Oyster Stout, This is another good one from Iwate Kura: the full ale malts, good booze, right sweetness together really back up the big-time hoppiness - very citrusy, oozy, spicey and smartly bitter. Hopefully my next bottle won't have these slightly bugging smelly grass nose. Yes, I did say next bottle. Hightly recommended! "

Moderate hops, orange citrus and sweet fruitiness highlight this tasty Imperial IPA. Of course, It's very malty as well, the sweet, caramely and grainy malts providing a solid, balancing base. The beer is moderately bitter at the beginning of each sip, though that aspect surely has mellowed to some extent. But along with a perception of increased hoppy bitterness, a slight spiciness emerges toward the finish as well. There is a moderate dusty quality in the background flavor and mouthfeel. Despite the sweet flavor, the mouthfeel is reasonably dry, and the dryness is enhanced by the dusty character. Medium-full bodied with soft carbonation, so overall, this is a smooth, pleasant-drinking IIPA. Sweet, grainy, very fruity and modestly hoppy nose seems to mirror the flavor for the most part, the hops being a bit more diminished aromatically. Very hazy, golden-amber in appearance with an off-white head that pours small, but dissipates at a very slow rate, never fading beyond a patchy film with a wide ring. Nice out of the bottle, I hope to see this at a local festival some day. "

This was a welcome surprise to be able to taste this along with the regular lineup on tap. Pours orange golden in color. The nose grabs you quickly with a heavy dose of pine resin and citrus. I'm not sure if the malts ever came through, but it was a great nose nonetheless. The flavor was more of the same but the malt presence was more pronounced. Still, this is about the hops; pine, citrus, and earthy. Medium/full mouthfeel and a pleasure to try. "

Once. Some people probably find it to be a gimmick - but either way : The pour is murky golden caramel with a modest off white head into this glass. It pours on the slow side because the hop cone tries to block the pour - Perhaps this isn't a brilliant idea afterall. Retention is average, with light spotting present. For fun - I pulled the hop cone out as well and let it rest on top of this foamy sea. The nose is somewhat striking - It's oily, dank, mild tropical, with pine needle presence and light caramel. The flavor profile shares that feeling - it is somewhat striking - at least somewhat different, which I attribute to the hop cone. However ; for an IIPA - It's just lacking in some avenues. Bittering pine needle, light citrus, caramel and biscuit presence - It's dank for sure. And it does mellow here as well. Unfortunately, i find that the malt backbone is lacking, somewhat, which leads to the finish fading into some sort of obscure feeling, overall. Ah well."

Pours a dark orange with a thin, bubbly, long-lasting, off-white head. Sweet malt overload (in a great way) on the first sip; the taste gradually grows to a tangy citrus blend that encompasses the smooth malt, with a rich resin note that leads to a semi-sweet, dry finish that leaves a pleasant light bitterness on the tongue. Medium body but heavier than many other DIPAs, with a slick texture that coats the mouth. Overall, It's another fine brew from the Beards, but methinks I slightly favor their Dos Cabezas imperial IPA over this one. "

Browar. I like it. A war amongst bros. Listed at 7% but I'd bet on 8 given how it went to my head. (On the other hand I basically inhaled it after eating nothing since breakfast.) So asked the server for a fresh hop IPA -- and given that there wasn't one, he recommended this. I wasn't particularly enthused, but I was too tired to argue, so this one it was. And I was downright pissed to see, after looking it up on ratebeer while waiting, that it was a DIPA not an IPA. But what a wonderful surprise. First of all the mouthfeel was sublime. Rich and creamy and so full without being the least bit sticky or pricky. Way darker in color than your average IPA, a deep brown, hinting at the full roasty flavors (without falling into the PacNW Christmas ale trap) to come. Nutty with molasses atop a mellow hop signature, beautiful balance. Nothing like a DIPA stickiness or hop-extravaganza. Gosh, I just love this beer. Tasty, way out of the box, top-notch stuff. tl;dr summary: Delicious malt-driven (!!) IPA. "

Aroma: great smelling beer--tons of bright citrus (lemon and prominent orange), and there's tropical fruit as well, especially pineapple; threading through that is a tart, sharp brett funk. Taste: tastes like nothing so much as a brett-spiked mimosa--orange and lemon and pineapple with a slightly lactic brett-barnyard funktopia going on; there's an undertone of rustic grain, I'm assuming from the spelt and rye in the malt bill. Finish: lingering tart citrus, with a bit of pie crust under. Notes: Yup, darn good. The brett was used perfectly; it was strong and added a ton of character, but didn't overpower. Had it with a charcuterie plate and it was the perfect pairing. Bottle from the Rare Beer Club. "

Sparkling copper-gold liquid is unfiltered, but only lightly hazy. Extremely fruity nose has notes of nectarine, peach, light banana and plentiful pale malt sugars behind it. Touches of lemon rind and black pepper provide dryness and the brett gains strength on the end adding light lime and other acids. Despite the brett and the phenols from the yeast, the malt is still very forward, even more so in the draught version. No alcohol noted. Light sugariness up front is a little odd, but I've tasted it before from brett beers, and It's added to lemony tartness and additional vanilla-like sweetness. Some slight pepperiness on the end ends up being most of the dryness in this thing. Breadiness builds up quickly and eventually is all I can taste. A sweet-and-tart flavor with expansive carbonation making the palate full and fluffy. Like lemon sugar coated white toast... The bottles were a bit more palatable than the recent draught version but still lacking an overall rustic character. Just too much bread, punchy fruit and fluffy carbonation.

It shows intense porous lacing with very good retention. The nose is dominated by spelt but also shows herbal, floral aspects(even soapy to some extent) from the earthy hops used in the brew. You can spot a fruity sweetness of cantaloupe and some (very) subtle toasted malts. On the tongue, it has a spicy attack with strong notes of spelt that slowly shifts to the barley malts and finishing herbal and earthy. Feels clean and just a bit acidic. With an IBU of 23, the bitterness is light and enjoyable. I think a higher IBU would have ruined the spicy and earthy elements so going for lighter hops was a good choice. Overall, this spelt amber ale is out of the ordinary and very refreshing. I would pair it goat cheese, fish and salads. Cheers! "

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation. I kinda feel bad rating something that's almost a year old already, especially a wee 4% Belgian golden ale. But yeasty golden ales age wayyyyyyyyy more gracefully than most darker beers (including Imperial stouts), especially if they have some acidity and aren't too sweet. This still has aromatic vibrancy and a very crisp, lively mouthfeel and balance, with a fair bit of yeasty tartness to go with the bitterness. Way more flavorful and fulfilling than most 4% brews I've ever had...surprising body. And as clean as a beer can get, with terrific water. No doubt this was even better within 6 months of its bottling, but It's impossible to stop sniffing and quaffing this little charmer as-is! Yvan is virtually peerless in the brewing world. "

I've been watching it for so long, wondering how long I should allow it to sit before cracking the cap, biding my time until I was sure that the magic was happening and I could enjoy the beauty of the brett. The time has come...I can't wait anymore. I've been thinking about this for weeks as the temperatures have climbed and the days have gotten longer. Now is the time. The liquid pours lemon-juice light and cloudy into the tulip, the head rises quickly and with little encouragement; visually a rocky, porous depth that thins significantly as I reach for the camera. The barnyard in the air is minimal, but promises are made by way of the bite in the grassy aroma; a bit of mellow citrus, but a tantalizing sting as I inhale. A pointed reaction under my tongue wets my mouth and prepares me for a deep quaff. The soft foam has settled now, and has reached its stopping point with a thin layer completely covering the brew. I pull my first mouthful. The brett is apparent, and funky is right, almost old socks; layers of flavor coming together through an unassuming malt on the nose, and an almost shocking dryness on my tongue and gums. I started out fairly cold, 42 degrees, and I must confess, this gets more earthy, more fruity, more flavorful as the brew warms. An odd reaction, but this lightweight brew hits a perfect spot at about 56 degrees. All of the flavor comes bursting forward; the grass, citrus and fruit, the tart dough. My mouth is watering like crazy, and still my teeth are finding each other akin to well used chalkboards. The experience has become delightful and I see now that I need to drink this out of the cooler twenty minutes or so to find it perfect! a great beer, a new experience; one I think everyone should try! This is a really nice brew! "

The label refers to it as a 'Saison IPA' and such a merger, I have never been acquainted with in the past. Aroma is clearly yeast and fresh grains (wheat malt) and the taste is first yeast and freshness in the form of newly harvested grain. The taste is rich with fresh grains that make up a nice sweet malt flavor where the yeast and a bit peppery spice taste. It is both malty and bitter at the same time, and the taste is slightly spicy in a good way. I certainly think that it is more Saison than IPA and as Saison it is a really wonderful experience. Only toward the end it has a little hoppy flavor that goes in the fruity direction, but quickly replaced by a citrus embossed fruit filling is best suited to Saison beer type. The finish has a little green apples, which also means that it is not for citrus tart in the end. "

Small white head but decent lacing. As soon as the first hint of the cap is open, the brandy is readily apparent. Upon deeper inspection there's an almost meaty quality to it. The other adjuncts filter in in layers: peppercorn, lemon zest, the anise is probably the most muted. Tart throughout and not just the lemon, but definitely the lemon as well. Some honey/apple sweet underneath as well. Layered, unique, interesting. Tart for sure, but not so bitter as to be difficult. Lemon tart for sure that feints towards that same apple sweetness, but is taken over by a drier woody and peppercorn character. Finish is definitely lemon tart with a little flourish at the finish. Again the anise is restrained and a supportive role if that. Solidly enjoyable. Complex. Probably not for everyone, but if the descriptor sounds enticing, JK does great work and this is no exception.

The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading to leave a moderate level of lace on the sides of the glass. Smell ' The aroma of the beer is quite heavy of a sweet and malty smell with lots of fruit of peach and apricot as well as a bit of toffee and some biscuit and bready malt smells. Along with these aromas are some lighter citrus and earthy hop mixed with just a hint of lemon. Taste ' The taste begins with a quite bready and sweet flavor with the sweet being a mix of the lighter fruits that were detected in the nose (peach and apricot). A little bit of orange and grape work their way onto the tongue more toward the middle of the taste, with them being joined by a somewhat grainy flavor. Toward the end, the apricot and peach really intensify and mix with a little amount of an earthy hop flavor and some light hay, leaving a nice fruity sweet and bready flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel ' The body of the beer is on the average to slightly lower side for a maibock of 7.0 % abv. with a carbonation level that is average. Overall a little thicker body may have been better for the heavy sweet and malty flavors of the brew, but overall the feel was alright. Overall ' A very easy drinking maibock at 7.0 % abv. with a nice big sweet and bready taste. Well worth a try. "

There's lots of sweet orange and piny mango character and a good bit of woody pine. There is a good bit of honey-like sweetness but nothing unreasonable for a big beer and it is mitigated by a huge resinous, citrus-rind bitterness. I might make a small complain that there is an ever so slight vegetable note from perhaps being released slightly too young for such a hoppy beer but I will take that over an old wood and cardboard tasting IPA any day.

Ap: love the elegant design of these labels. Beautiful thicker orange, frothy pour. - Aroma on this beer is a delicately layered mission statement: near Orval-like brett outlines the rich canvas for the sweet orange and peach marmelade IPA hops to shine on. Floral, wild orange blossom elements merge with a sweet, contained Belgian yeast to underline the savage floristics this aptly named composition. - ridiculously drinkable at that: takes the balance of mostly EU earthy hops from Belle Fleur and adds a wild honey, sweet citrus rind jam and aged malt sweetness in combination with a thicker yeast profile, while the subtle, organic tasting brett keeps all that under dry control. Never would have imaged a barrel-aged IPA to be such a deliciously good idea and so drinkable despite its complexity. Truly introducing some of the best elements of Belgian brewing artistry to global 21st century trends. "

Fair amount of earthy herbal hop/oaky/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, lime, orange peel, pineapple, peach, green apple, pepper, hay, straw, grass, musty funk, oak, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky yeast, citrus/earthy hops, and oak barrel flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish.

Shared with Annie about an hour after I filled it, on her patio. It was cold outside, the beer stayed pretty chilled. Clear orange color. Thin white head. Little dots of lace. Bigger body. Good smooth lighter carbonation. More dry. I was pretty disappointed by the Shipwrecked DIPA, but this Armada is pretty good. Much better, much more what I'm looking for. Good balance of hop and malt, both with enjoyable flavor profiles. The malt isn't too heavy with the caramel, more biscuity, pretty nice. Grassy, lightly citrusy hop flavor. Kind of drinks like a 7.5%-8% IPA actually, in both aroma and taste, which is pretty sneaky. Doesn't taste too big or boozy, nor too aggressive or assertive in the flavor. Taste is kind of bitter, good amount of sweet, nearly no hint of the big alcohol. Nice, surprisingly drinkable DIPA. "

I didn't see the label when I purchased it recently (I feel justified in rating it because it was purchased recently in this state off the shelf, not forgotten in my cellar). Pours a hazy orange-bronze with a small amount of short-lasting, beige head. The liquid would be worthy of a 4 with even average head. Scents of apricot, paint, booze, and urine. Smells more like a barley wine than a double IPA. Dry, floral taste features flavors of urine, cracker, orange, and honey. Everything is off. Not good. Full body. Undercarbonated in the palate. I suspect this would have been a not very good beer in its prime (too boozy and jumbled), but it is actively bad at this point. I used the majority for cooking, which is my equivalent of a drain pour, and the food I cooked didn't taste very good due to the presence of this beer. "

Aroma is pineapple, candied orange and some pine hops. Fruit upfront which reminds me again of pineapple with tropical fruit hints. But don't let the fruit fool you, this has the four C's of hop variety that gives a big bold lingering pine blast in the finish to let you know this is from the west Coast! The mouthfeel has a nice lively tingle in a normal medium body. The four C's are on display very nicely in this DIPA, another finely crafted beer from this brewer. "

There is also the feeling of a fruity presence that is almost of apricot with a touch of vanilla. Alcohol is noticeable and overall mouthfeel is very enjoyable dry finish."

Full-on lush, leafy hoppiness seems fresh and very unfined. Especially fresh. Amarillo hops are pretty touchy and here we have tons of tangerine and light cherry notes with touches of marmalade and only a hint of pine on the end. Seemingly well-attenuated with only some light white bread and a hint of caramel. A touch of yeastiness, but It's passing and the lovely hop extraction more than outshines it. As well, the alcohol is shockingly well-hidden for this level. The flavor is a fruit cocktail of cherry, lime, grapefruit and plentiful but not overdone honey and light caramel malt sweetness. Well-balanced and with an appropriate bitterness drying out the finish and giving it a pleasant zestiness, all with tight, engaging carbonation helping to clear the palate. Some touches of yeast blandness here and there and maybe tending a touch too astringent/dry (gasp!) at times, but the hop flavor is incredible, the production on the beer is top-notch and yet it still retains its fresh, unfiltered feel to it. Really easy drinking and aside from just a hint of pine sap building up by the end of the bottle, quite free from that menace. I'm sad I didnt try more pipeworks beers while I was in Chicago, but there's always next time. "

The color is a clear gold with a orange hue. Head was small and didn't last. Aroma leads me to believe it is a standard American IPA: orange and tropical fruit with moderate level for bread like malt character. The flavor has a bit more depth. Malts lean on the English side with a light earthy note. Hops are a blend of citrus upfront followed by a floral and mild pine hiding in the finish. Overall for me it is an extremely drinkabl, well made IPA that was easy to kill a pint. Bitterness is there with a dryness but not to aggressive. Classic in every sense. "

Has a medium body with a pretty creamy mouthfeel and a semi dry, semi bitter, medium-long finish. Overall, a pretty nice east coast style ale that is pretty malty but still has a nice hop bite to it.

A honey like floral tone is sticky and messy, but it serves to co-opt the butterscotch impression of the nose. Sourish, yuzu and overripe tangerine fruit flavors, and sticky toffee. This is the fourth less than ideally carbonated beer from this establishment. It's impossible to not speculate that they're rushing beers to meet demand. The slick, rather heavy texture makes the persistent buttery coloring all the more noticeable.

There is a light floral note that becomes apparent upon multiple sips. Dry, tonic / soda / mineral water aftertaste that reminds me of green grape seeds.

The hops are omnipresent with a nice light toasty malt for balance. Very citrus and crisp bitterness throughout the taste. An outstanding mouthfeel and finish.

I like that, although I feel like there's some consistent imbalances in the two beers I've tried. The malts are quite sugary compared to other beers out there, which makes them feel heartier but I don't really dig how they finish. High alcohol is masked in taste but it definitely catches up with you! I appreciate what this fella is trying to do but It's just not really my style.

Farmhouse IPA brings and hop and floral scent that sets your mind in a good direction for the upcoming taste. Lightly hazy and straw yellow in color with a bubbly near overflow of white head and moderate lacing. Farmhouse is a bit more than lightly sweet with a nice hop bitterness that returns to a sweet finish that lingers till the next sip. The texture of Farmhouse IPA is a bit oily with a lively carbonation, a light hoppy body that again has a nice sweet long finish. This bottle was 50 days old at drinking and I can just imagine no matter what the age it would be a great drink! "

This was from my AZ trip back in April this year. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a nice looking hazy orange to amber color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute leaving some light lacing trickling along the glass. The smell had a floral and citrus hoppiness up front letting some light caramel malts try to balance but still the hops are on the main stage. The taste was a very nice bittersweet floral to citrus flavoring with a delicate light extra fruitiness. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat sharp but placed itself on the harshness as it rolled over my tongue. Overall, I say this was a pretty good AIPA well worthy of having again."

The head has a fantastic level of retention, slowly fading to leave a good level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell ' The aroma of the beer is biggest of a bready smell mixed with some hoppy aromas of a citrus and pine nature. Along with these smells are some sweeter smells of caramel and a bit of orange, which when mixed with a little bit of an earthy hop smell, produce a nicely balanced IPA aroma. Taste ' The taste begins with a sweeter and doughier flavor. The sweeter tastes are a mix of caramel and tangerine with them starting out quite strong and losing some ground as the taste advances to the end. While not too hoppy upfront, some hop flavors begin working their way into the taste as it advances from the start. The hops start almost entirely of a citrus nature, but soon have other flavors of earth and pine mixing in with the earthy hop ending up becoming one of the more potent of the hop flavors toward the end. With a little bit of a cracker taste replacing some of the more doughy flavors, the slight decrease in the sweet, and increase in the hop, one is left with a moderately hopped and smooth malty taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel ' The body of the beer is on the medium side in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is on the average side as well. Overall the medium body is nice for the mix of the cracker and sweeter flavors of the brew, while not being too thin to support the hop flavors of the brew. The average carbonation likewise was a good compromise for the two sets of hop and sweet flavors, overall creating a very balanced and more refreshing drinker. Overall ' While not a hop powerhouse the beer has a nice blend of flavors and an enjoyable taste as a good Belgian IPA should be in my opinion (we are not looking for hops for the sake of hops here...). Even at 8.5 % abv, it certainly does not have it in the taste, with this brew being on the more easy drinking side. "

I have never had anything like it before. On tap at Cigar City in July 2013. Pours a thick black. The aroma was rich: chocolate, brandy, vanilla. I wish I could try the Hanahpu. But then I tasted it, and although there was a slight thick imperial sweetness, the pepper is strong. I would have said overpowering, but I have not had a beer like this. But the pepper/chili in this beer is the type that makes your eyes water and stomach hurt. So after getting that in my nose and on my palate, I could not taste anything else. My tongue and my lips tingled with that pepper taste for a while. To me, that makes the heat of the beer too much. As it warmed, it was pure heat. I would not call this balanced. Even at 3.5 I think I am higher than I would have rated another beer simply because its Cigar City.

I can't stand ghost peppers but this combination works like no other beer in this class. Everything hunahpu has, sweet Carmel, vanilla,malty chocolate with brandy barrel is perfectly balanced against the heat and spice of the ghost pepper. Some chili beers reach for the extreme to try and melt your face. This was not the case here bravo for one of the best beers of 2012."

I guess I should read the description on these beers first, as I was thinking the wood and smoke was out of character. Coffee comes through more as it warms. Damn this is good stuff!

I've cellared this one for a while, today It's the perfect time to open it. Pitch black with a small brown head. Looks good! Aroma has lots of liquorice tones (think bay leaf and laurel) with a faint whiskey note. Also some hints of wood, roast, dust, earth, chalk, some serious dark chocolate, light mocha tint and some dry coffee tints. Flavour is earthy. Earthy when all lights go out! Very dark tones of liquorice, roast, coffee and wood burn, nut (roast), dry, light whiskey, light herbal roast, some dark chocolate, hint of mocha, hint of tar... Very dark, dark roast/burn with a light earthy edge and a dry jacket. Interesting! Aftertaste is bitter and dry with many different roast/burn tones like wood, malts and some coffee. Also a hint of chocolate. Low carbo, thick close to silky mouthfeel, full bodied. Interesting beer! "

Dude, this an amazing beer. This year's release is a little higher alcohol, but the booze doesn't become detrimental. The body is near black and viscous with a long lasting dark head. Loads of bittersweet dark malt give the perception of cacao with real coffee coming through very nicely. The barrel aging is perfect. The palate is dense and creamy. Notes of rich chocolate, coffee and tasteful oak and vanilla make this a savory sipper. Breweries aren't cranking out barrel aged imperial stouts like they used to, so this is a perfect local addition to the seasonal beer scene. "

I like it as It's a little spicy and a little meaty. Theres a certain nitrite flavor to this beer. Some dark malts, hint of blackstrap and some graham as well. Medium on heavy with low carb. i would argue a little more carb would go a long way to help open this beer up. Alcohol is not notable on the flavor. I liked this beer.

Appearance: Pours your usual impenetrable stout black, and forms a thin head of dark tan bubbles. The head is relatively short-lived, and leaves no trace behind as it dies - with the word trace including lacing. Smell: That's definitely a chocolate mint stout - for a moment, I thought I'd just opened a package of Andes Thin Mints and inhaled. There's a backdrop of charred malt, but primarily sweet chocolate and mint. Taste: This opens with a roasty-bitter, blackened grain bill, that quickly - nigh instantly - recedes to allow a swell of milk chocolate and mint leaves to rush in. As it moves through the middle, the mint intensifies, to the point that the flavor profile becomes almost herbal. By the finish, however, the chocolate returns in force, and the finish and aftertaste remind me again of an Andes Thin Mint. The roasted bitterness remains present through the entire tasting process, tinging each phase with charcoal, and there's an earthy sort of bitter at times as the beer moves along. Mouthfeel: Slick and creamy, though towards the lighter end of full-bodied / higher end of medium-bodied. Overall: An interesting take on a stout, highlighting the chocolate aspects and splicing them with a mintiness that seems so intense at times, it almost has to be mint oil. I don't know if I'd repeat, but It's not a bad stout. "

Big frothy mocha head with average retention and some light foamy lace. Aromas of coffee, chocolate malt, molasses and hints of dark fruits. The taste starts off on a wrong note though, with some rustiness from the hops. Does get better with actual bitterness in the finish. Pretty bitter for an Impy Stout. Chocolate and coffee lingers.

Aroma of alcohol, roasted malt, yeast, rye, cedar, grain and a bit of chocolate - pungent throughout. Full-bodied; Super creamy and pungent malt backbone of rye, oatmeal, roasted malt all with a ridiculous amount of milk, vanilla, chocolate and raisins and a tremendous amount of sugars at the finish. Aftertaste is complex and deep with a lot of alcohol notes, some chocolate, a good dose of lactose and a creamy, ridiculously full-bodied vanilla and sugar sweetness. Overall, this feels like a milkshake almost due to the insane body, but with a very complex profile and a subdued depth from alcohol and sugars make this probably one of the best Imperial Stouts i've ever had, plus It's from Alaska which makes it that much better.

Translates well into the taste with a bit more emphasis on the sweet side than on the roast. Has some dark fruits and a light floral hop presence that really helps the finish from being noticeably cloying. Good stuff, a traditional 'meat and potatoes' example of the American RIS. "

There is just a hint of alcohol on the back end. The flavor is better than it smells. There is an excellent roastiness to carry the chocolate malts and the dark fruits bring back a bit of sweetness.

And here I thought we were past the non-dating our specialty releases....So, no idea the age on this one.... Deep, dark ebony pour yields a large light tan head that is very well-retained. Nice, that's encouraging to see. I tried this at room temp (about 65 degrees) and chilled (50 degrees) and I much preferred the chilled serving. In both aroma and flavor its just massively vinous. Prunes, treacle, heavy char and massively oily, acidic tannin. The cooler temperature helps alleviate some of this, allowing the lightly chocolatey, moderately sweet yeti to break through. The body is comforting, rather oily/slick but also bolstered by the tight carbonation and large malt bill. On one hand, I like that It's not a mouth full of bourbon. The barrel used seems to be at least 2nd generation and so It's just more actual charred/toasted oak character and less boozy whiskey. That being said, the acidity builds up more and more on the palate and even slowly sipping half of the bottle became a chore after a while, despite my pairing it with a cigar. Hate to say it, but this sure would be ALOT better if it had been aged 9 months instead of 20! "

This will be a slow sipper for sure. Comes from a 37,5 cl 'geuze' bottle with black neckfoil. Very dark ruby brown, almost pitch black, under a thin, milky, light beige 'veil' of tiny bubbles; caramel brown oily 'legs' remain on the edges of the glass after emptying. Dense, enticing, strong aroma of bitter cocoa nibs, fondant chocolate, marshmallows, pipe tobacco, cigar ashes, Snickers, cognac, oaky tannins, raisins, cold black coffee and cappuccino, marmelade, candied oranges and dates, raspberry coulis, hints of charcoal, burnt wood, peat, banana, shoe polish but not disturbingly so - in all, very impressive. Densely sweet, sugary, very 'bonbon'-like onset, very concentrated, creamy milk chocolate with banana, mocha ice cream, candied figs and raisins, sweet jam and a Mars bar or something of that kind, after which a thin but tangy kind of soft acidity blends in; mouthfeel is obviously very thick and creamy, but very smooth and supple as well, with soft carbonation. The middle phase is very intensely bittersweet chocolate malts, very profoundly so, as if you are pouring down chocolate sauce in some Michelin-starred restaurant... An oily and milky coating of intense candied sweetness persists till well into the finish and there is a kind of metallic 'sound' too, but it does not bother me; along with the thick and syrupy 'chocolateness', very sweet but strangely not very cloying, some deep, earthy hop bitterness comes up in the finish, but remains buried under retronasal coffee 'roastedness', the initial acidity drying a bit, a ton of wood (I can litterally taste 'wooden furniture' somewhere at the back) with all the vanilla-like tannins accompanying it, and, needless to say, a strong kick of alcohol, creating a heat as it goes down, but still remaining noble and 'aristocratic', as in a fine French liqueur or top quality cognac. 'Imperial sweet stout', the label says, and indeed a litterally milk chocolate and candied sweetness is key here, but in a noble way and balanced beautifully by the bittering alcohol and oak dryness. Roasted bitterness is there somewhere underneath all the sweet chocolate, but provides background structure rather than a deep bitter flavour, though a coffee touch is certainly there. Very fascinating beer, a giant as it were, very intense, bold, uncompromising and demanding respect... Big stout the Scandinavian, I'd almost say 'Viking' way - this brewery did it again. Surely the most intense beer I had this weekend, ideal sipper for a quiet and rainy Sunday afternoon. In terms of style, I'd regard this as a hybrid between a (barrel aged) imperial stout and a milk stout, which makes it all the more fascinating. "

The appearance had a dark brown close to black color with a slim finger's worth of off white foamy head that dissipated within less than thirty seconds. Stringy lacing glosses along the sides of the glass. The smell was decadent peanut butter chocolate, pure and luscious in every sort of aspect. The taste was definitely more Imperial stout as the peanut butter was there but more scaled back. I didn't mind so much. The aftertaste was dry and somewhat had a peanut butter connotation to it. A semi - sweet sticky finish accompanies the end. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sipping quality about it. The carbonation seemed pretty controlled and allowed a decent creaminess to roll over the tongue. Overall, I say this was an exceptional AI/DS with the peanut butter part well executed. Definitely would have again! "

Caught somewhere in that awkward space between high boost stout and rich imperial stout, it suffers from a lack of clear mission. I would give these guys another shot if I could get a few samples but I doubt I will be hurrying to try anything else unless I happen to be passing through. Aroma / Appearance - A rich velvety base pours clean and dense with an ochre head. Oily legs betray the higher gravity. Chocolate and coffee linger in the air like an unhealthy breakfast combination. The smooth creamy profile gets the job done but lacks any substantial defining feature to leave an impression. Licorice and ash alone will not do it. Flavor / Palate - The dense mouthfeel owes more to the number of ingredients than anything else. Melted bittersweet chocolate coats the mouth with an oily resin. Raspberries linger a brief second before a bitter transfer to a warm boozy finish. Fruity chocolate and coffee briefly perk up the senses before the tedium returns. This lacks any huge flaws other than the fact that it simply cannot compete with the best of the best. Save some time and money for another alternative. "

Pours black with a very very large tan head that (unsurprisingly) leaves some lacing on the glass. I sort of love a ridiculous head every once in a while. The aroma is dark chocolate, dark fruit, toasted marshmallows, and generally just a whole bunch of rich maltiness. It's got some nice leafy hoppiness in there as well. Geeze it sort of smells like a less sweet Dark Lord, no joke. The flavor is defiantly a step above what I normally want from a stout with regards to malt bitterness, but It's chill.... balancing factors of caramel, chocolate, & leafy hops bring some sanity to the table. There is almost an espresso like quality to it with all the roastiness and bitterness, but then there is a nice plum and blackberry thing as well. The palate is... how can I say, thinner than the flavor would have you believe it would be? That's not to say It's a thin beer or that it has a poor mouthfeel, but usually stouts that taste like this have a higher viscosity on the tongue. It's sort of cool that It's a little more lively and not as brooding on the palate as other stouts that taste like it. No matter how I try to fight it, I am a damn sucker for a good Imperial Stout. "

Overall, pretty solid and tasty. 14.4 "

Fair bit boozy but not overpoweringly so.

The nose is more smokey than I anticipated and also features sweet and boozy bourbon, medium coffee, decadent chocolate, toffee, light cinnamon, very roasted barley, and the briefest spicy touch of charred adobo. It's flat black in color with a dark tan ring head. Wow, smooth doesn't begin to describe the taste. Chocolate is the primary flavor and is accompanied by velvety bourbon, dry cinnamon with a slightly woody finish. The rich syrup lends only sweetness at first without any distinct maple taste, but it increases greatly as the beer warms to eventually become the dominant flavor. The body is a tiny thin for an imperial stout. It's a beautiful beer, but I wouldn't consider it the best barrel-aged stout I've tried. "

I'm not complaining. Early vintage just kills it in the nose. Mouth goes totally to the gold. This thing has a finish that lasts minutes. Seriously. It's rich. It's big. It's dessert.

Side-by-side tasting of the Morning Delight, Assassin , KBBS (all 2013) and SR-71 (freshest). All of the beers have a good dose of silky smooth and rich sweetness, molasses and roasted barley malts in them. All of them are great beers. - Morning Delight: more on the freshly roasted coffee, some green paprica too, sometimes a bit too rich. 4.1/5 - Assassin: my personal favourite: very balanced aroma: slight alcohol that accentuates the subtle roasted coffee notes and chocolate, together with some oak and vanilla touch. 4.5/5 - KBBS: very thick and rich, loads of molasses. Nice barrel touch. 4.3/5 - SR-71: a lot more alcohol in the aroma, as well as peanuts and roasted nuts. 4.0/5 "

The beer poured an opaque black colour with a one finger brown head that dissipated fairly quickly leaving a thin whispy layer and spotty lacing. Strong aromas of chocolate mixed in with coffee, caramel and vanilla. There is also a hint of whisky alcohol aroma. Taste is much like the aroma. Chocolate and espresso coffee dominate followed by hints of slightly burnt caramel and vanilla. There is also some roasted malts and oakiness but not a lot of whisky even though its aged in whiskey barrels. Full bodied, light carbonation, smooth. Overall, I'm a sucker for coffee, whisky and beer (my three favourite drinks). Now put together into a single drink, although the whisky is not so prominent here, this brew is fantastic. It's right up there with Founders Breakfast Stout and Evil Twin Imperial Biscotti Break. Another must buy beer to add to my list. "

It's a bourbon stout with a splash of a rather artificial vanilla extract maybe some honey sweetness. Light and drinkable but doesn't suffer from the typical light beer in a barrel syndrome. Also I saw somewhere that this was 11%. Don't know if that's accurate but I'd it at 8%. Decent but below average for a ba imperial stout but still tasty and worth trying."

The pour is a light black out of the bottle with a thin tan head and no lace as it falls down to a ring. The aroma is a little boozier than I was expecting compared to some of the others in the series. There is a decent vanilla and a sweet lactose kind of chocolate. The coffee I was expecting is just about gone. The flavor is a little better. There is a beautiful roast and some great chocolate. again the coffee seems to be missing. There is a strong sweetness to accompany some vanilla that meshes well, but comes off almost too sweet. The mouth feel is decent. It's got a good thickness, but I am disappointed in the carbonation. It allows the beer to fall off of the tongue quickly. The aftertaste is the best part. It's got a good coffee presence and a well blended mix of chocolate and vanilla. Aside from that, I'm a little disappointed. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone "

From Dan, thanks! >>> The good old BCBS combine with loads of vanilla for a tasty and mouth coating dessert beer. + Really flavorful and despite the strong vanilla presence, the other components like coffee, rye whiskey, caramel, fudge and marshmallow aren't hidden so that gives the beer a good complexity + The body is full and the palate is rich. The low carbonation combined to the sweetness and strong vanilla presence results in a lingering luscious marshmallow-like mouth coating sweetness − The heavy sweetness combined to the strong vanilla presence did a good job to mask the alcohol, but that can get cloying fast. Enjoyable in small quantity ○ I'm not saying that there's not enough vanilla presence in this one, but the former bourbon version was more vanilla-forward at 3 years old than this one right now.

This is a great looking beer! A dark black body, only the lightest hint of dark brown on the edges in the light. The head is a surprisingly light shade of tan for the body but there is tons of it and it looks great. Creamy and full, a great cap and lacing... The aroma is quite interesting but not my favorite part of the beer, its unique but confusing. Huge cocoa and nut notes that somehow come off to me as fresh green dry hops, reminds me of a fresh Night Stalker. I also get some chocolate, molasses, and weed. Has me interpreting new things, really great... The taste is really roasty cocoa, its bitter but also reminds of being dry hopped. Additional notes of grass and chocolate covered Brazil nuts... The mouthfeel is tannic and sticky, full bodied, long lasting smooth finish. A really interesting stout that will expand your flavor notions of a stout. High recommendation. "

Fairly sweet aroma, dark fruit, yeast, and not too much else. Once people started smoking it pretty much shot any chance of smelling anything...thanks Virginia for letting people smoke in restaurants! Wouldn't mind revisiting aroma w/a growler. Taste is a little smokey at time, a lot of toasted graininess, some alcohol, yeast, and light hops. Decent mouthfeel, very smooth, and has a semi-dry, long finish. Could stand to be a little thicker. Was served a little cold and in a pint glass, so was hard to get aromas. Easy drinking and pretty good, but a far cry from a world class imperial stout. Strangely, this reminded me of Southampton 10th at times...pretty good bt unusual and not at all what I was expecting. "

Consumed on 1-29-15. Pours a quite dark brown, darker and less reddish than the non-barrel-aged version, which I had in the same flight. The aroma delivers more port or, to a lesser extent, brandy than whiskey, although I do get some whiskey. Scents of shriveled red grapes and raisins. Quite nice smell but falls short of that of an actual port. Also chocolate and vanilla scents. The flavor, like the aroma, is very port-like and grapey. Whiskey in the finish but otherwise not much whiskey flavor. Chocolate and vanilla flavors. Lacks the coffee flavor of the non-barrel-aged version. Tones down both the coffee char and the sweetness while adding the fortified wine quality. Lightly acidic finish. Charred aftertaste, lightly so. Full body. Smooth in the palate. Good beer across the board. Perhaps sweeter than ideal upon multiple sips. The booziness piles up as well. This is one of those beers that isn't as good at the end as at the beginning, for which I subtract a point from the overall score. It's still quite good nonetheless. "

First beer that comes to mind is Logsdon Peche N Brett, but the juicy/fuzzy peach character here seems to take a back seat to the saison yeast. Soft and delicate nectarine is obvious as it warms. Taste is only lightly tangy playing into the fruited saison category well vs. pure peach sour. Light doses of saltwater and nectarine inside of a bubbly, champagne like body. Quick neutral finish. It's fairly refreshing/quenching with no lingering sourness. This one has really done well with the peach saison assignment. "

We've long felt a strong kinship with Prairie because of their commitment to artisan brewing principles, their geographical closeness, their quirky, amazingly clever artwork, and the fact that they're genuinely good people. Having Chase Healey of Prairie come to Jester King back in August of 2014 to make a beer with us was a great honor and a lot of fun. We're so pleased to share the results of our collaborative effort! Our motivation behind the beer was to highlight our similar brewing philosophies, which incorporate locally sourced ingredients and mixed culture fermentation. Chase brought rosemary grown in a garden near his Oklahoma brewery to Jester King, and Jester King Head Brewer Garrett Crowell picked lemon bee-balm growing in a pasture near the brewery for the beer. These two ingredients, native to our respective locations, were added to the boil, along with a healthy dose of Nelson Sauvin hops. The wort was then fermented in oak barrels for three months with Jester King's unique mixed culture of microorganisms consisting of brewer's yeast and native yeast and bacteria cultured from the air and wildflowers around the brewery. Natural Union was brewed with Hill Country well water, malted barely, Texas-grown raw wheat, raw sugar, hops, rosemary, and lemon bee-balm, and fermented in oak barrels with Jester King's mixed culture, as described above.

From Mark, thanks! Clear golden with a medium white head, some retention and some lacing. Aroma is peppery/spicy and yeasty with hints of pear and herbal notes. Taste is also peppery and yeasty with hints of pear and a sticky bitter herbal finish. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Slightly dry finish. Decent Saison. The herbal finish is too powerful and sticky for my liking and I'm not sure the pear really helps the beer (it probably hinder drinkability), but otherwise this is a good peppery Saison. "

The beer's head is massive and creamy almost-yellow, made of medium sized, slightly soapy bubbles that sit over three finger's widths above the glass and hardly fade at all. In body, the beer is dark and murky with a decent amount of haze and very little visibility of the other side of the glass. Tiny bubbles can be seen all around, racing to replenish the head at the top of the glass, but no particles can be found in the beer. The beer's head leaves a thick, bearded lacing along the glass which is quite surprising to see. On the nose, the beer smells uniquely juicy, almost like apple juice and juicy fruit, except for quick expressive bursts of citrus and caramel malt that suggest more to the beer. There is even a light, generic spiciness to it as you stick your nose in the beer. Slight gooseberry notes, like in a sauvignon blanc, can also be detected, heralding the presence of Nelson Sauvin hops. On the tongue, the beer tastes malty sweet with a superb balancing bitter and a light bite of acid. In flavor the beer is a little bland, which leads me to believe that I'm a little late on the hop-life of this beer, which is too bad. The flavor begins with caramel malts and a touch of stale bread, moving slowly towards gooseberry and a touch of not-displeasing plastic flavoring that fringes on sweet grapefruit pith with a touch of bitter pine. Light apple juice flavors wander in the middle palate, giving the beer an interesting fruitiness. The finish blends pine and caramel malt in a nice blend that reminds me of an old school DIPA's. The aftertaste is tartly sweet, sort of like what the mouth tastes like after drinking apple juice. In the mouth, the beer feels on the plus side of medium in body with a lightly prickly carbonation that fluffs the tongue and then leaves a light bite. The mouth is left sticky with saliva forming on its edges. Overall, I'm a little confused by this beer. I'm fairly certain that it is a little past its prime, but I by no means hated it. The flavors of the beer were interesting and different, and I would have loved to have seen them bolder and more pronounced, which they no doubt were when the beer was fresh. I've loved everything I've had from Rising Tide, and I still really liked this, its' just a little past its prime. Rising Tide, please brew this beer again so I can try it fresh! It's got nice maltiness and a touch of bitter hops at the end that balance it beautifully, but it seems to be missing something at this point. "

I was hesitant to buy this at first seeing as I have never heard of this brewery before, but the 1200 bottle count and the fact that it used Nelson Sauvin hops swayed me to take the plunge. WARNING: As soon as I began unscrewing the cage the cork started to rise. No gush over but this thing is under some solid pressure. A - Pours a lightly hazy orange/amber body. A massive head forms initially but settles down to a neat fingers worth of the white stuff after a few minutes. Some really gorgeous lacing and long lasting retention after swirling the glass. S - Farmhouse meets the hop house. My god this is amazing. Notes of grass, plums, cereal grains and light spices segway right into the Nelson Sauvin which features just an incredible fruit bouquet of green grapes, nectarines, honey and some light dank herb. Smells somewhat syrupy and dense. Please turn this into an air freshener! T - Very similar to the nose. It starts off very biere de garde like with fruity malts, crackers, grass and some spice. In the middle lies the great Nelson hop notes of dry sauvignon blanc wine, stone fruit and honey. The end returns to the spice and malty. Mouth feel is full and well carbonated. 7.9% abv? Couldn't tell at all. O - I'm a total Nelson fan boy, but the combination of that hop in a biere de garde is something of beauty. I would not even think to age this one as the hops, which never dominate, provide just the right amount of flavor to elevate this beer into something truly special. This beer was a total surprise, I just love it. "

Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. The beer poured a very hazy burnt orange colour with quite a bit of yeast sediment with a half finger white head. Normally I'm ok with sediment but for some reason, this time it didn't look too good. Given its appearance, its aromas became more important to me in determining whether something was wrong. But actually it smelled quite good. A strong whiff of citrus sour lemon mixed with some barnyard brett. However its taste left something to be desired as it was mainly acidic sour citrus lime, lemon, orange and bitter pine. It started out ok but the aftertaste was not. Thin to medium bodied, but well carbonated almost like soda water. Also left a dry finish. I normally enjoy saisons, but I just did not get this at all. I wish there was at least a bottled or best before date on the bottle to indicate its freshness, but there was none. I also saw no indication of anything wrong with it and its aroma seemed fine, so I can only say that tastewise this particular brew from Omnipollo was just not for me. "

Cloudy golden & slightly orange tinted body; quite hazed. Light-beige colored head bubbles up upon pouring & settles pretty quickly as a chunky collar. Aroma is full blast on stone fruit & ripping peach acidity, juicy undertones with a waft of both underripe skin tartness & overripe sweet flesh. So damn fruity. Undercurrent of mild yogurt, lactic acid, white wine, & a moderately tannic, yet smooth & musty wood presence. Flavor is on POINT. Delicious mix of semi-funky farmhouse yeast, mineral water, vinous oak notes, ripe peach fruits, lemon flesh acidity, citric back-splash, & a touch of wine-like white grape towards the finish. The yogurty presence is mostly usurped by a more acidic & aggressively tart peach & stone fruit sourness but there's still a nice gulp of lacto towards the finish. Mild oak & wet hay notes are tertiary to the fruit maceration but still play integral roles in this divine beast. Dry finish, almost spritzy but not quite thin enough with mildly vinous tannins & a faint peach kiss left on the palate. Simply a fantastic fruited wild ale on all fronts. "

Initial is firmer funk and big tannic red wine is potent and a bit funky. Some cobwebs, sweet tarts and firmer tannic red wine presence keeps growing. Some earthiness, oak, gentle fruit and bready malts. Dry straw, more funk. A potent barrel. Middle is bready, almost some acidity from the barrel, rich and wine driven, but not sour.

Aromas of lightly tart lemon zest, green apple, pear, cracker, bread, light honey, hay, straw, grass, herbal, light pepper, funk, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with balanced malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, green apple, pear, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, straw, floral, grass, pepper, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of green apple, pear, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, straw, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of malt and fruity yeast flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall, despite obvious infection, this was a nicely enjoyable brew. Obviously not to style, but was tasty for what was there. Very smooth and crisp to drink as well. "

Served cold in a tulip pint. A - A deep copper burnished caramal w/ an inch of light cream that drops quickly. Has a fine bead. There is moderate stickage. The contrast between the red/amber and light tan head is striking as the rings of lace cling tenaciously. S - Nice mellow simcoe and cascade citrus w/ subtle floral notes and tangerine/clementine-like juicy sweet aromas. M - Very mild bitterness seamless malt and hop unity, the sweetness seems to be submerged at first but actually works in tandem w/ the slightly bitter and tart notes of the fresh hop notes riding the fruity and effervescent feel. T - Very much like a pale ale w/ the accent ofn the flavor of the simcoe and the cascade along for the ride. I am very impressed w/ the 1st beer I have had at a brewpub in Indiana. Nice malt anchoring(no pun intended) the sweetness is restrained, but has a nice dry and lightly grainy mild roasteed flavor w/ subtle rye notes -kind of bready as it warms w/ a subtle astringency and the hop flavors remain all the way true to the end. D - Described as a 'session beer' on the menu, I can't exactly agree, but 5.6% is close enough. Very Drinkable, I could return to this without hesitation. For me this has a swiss army type of universal flavor. The malt smoothness and plenty of hop sweetness and citrus flavor. This ale is well crafted and hard to find fault with the quality. "

First reviewed 11/19/2011. Tried at Fobab, with notes from a second sampling at Goose Island. Served on tap in a 10 oz. snifter. My pour is a hazy brown color with a few hints of burgundy at the edges. A tan sea foam froth rests on top, fading to a light ring after a few minutes. The aroma is much more bourbon forward than the flavor. After my nose processes the strong bourbon note, vanilla is the next strongest aroma. Sweet toffee, caramel, figs, and dates impart a strong sweetness, with a bit of roast malt and oak in the back. As mentioned above, the bourbon plays a much more gentle role in the flavor, allowing the base flavors to really shine through. There is such an incredible vanilla flavor here, especially for a barleywine. The flavors are blended well together, with each component bringing more vanilla out. Caramel and toffee provide an enhanced sweetness with just a bit of roast to the malt presence up front. The gooey sweetness carries over to toffee soaked figs and dates and some rum raisin makes an appearance as well. Toward the end the bourbon presses through, helping to soften the gooey sweetness and bring out some of the barrel character as well. The finish is smooth, still fairly sweet, and full of vanilla. My only true knock on this beer is that the carbonation feels fizzy. With a smoother, creamier carbonation, I would bump this score a point and probably the overall score half a point, really bringing it into the elite category. The rest of the body has a nice, full mouthfeel, with a gooey stickiness that is only partially softened by the barrel dryness toward the end. A bit of bourbon alcohol presence pleasantly reminds me of the 9.2% ABV. This was a strong offering for GI to bring to Fobab. A very good bourbon barrel barleywine. This does not really push any boundaries, but there is no crime in simply aging a barleywine in bourbon barrels well. "

S: Sweet malts, toffee, alcohol, an atypical scent that must be brettanomyces. I am quite unfamiliar with brett in this context, and find this beer quite intriguing. T: The beer is decent tasting. The flavor is unusual, but not off-putting, like I feared. Of course, It's malt heavy with some nice toffee notes. Bourbon comes through in the finish.

The aroma is rich, It's got lots of caramel, some cooked fruit, some brown sugar... invitingly sweet smelling. The flavor is rich & sweet, It's got loads of toffee, lots of fruity cherry and apple bits. There is a touch of bitterness left in it, but that's pretty light. Some vanilla rounds it out well. The mouthfeel is big, but lightly sharp. A real chill boost. "

Good flavor, but mostly just sweet and boozy."

But it wasn't until Will Meyers (the great Cantabridgian Cervecero) brought this method to our attention that we realized we could brew a barleywine of proper gravity... (he never told us that he hadn't actually performed this sort of brewing before!). Anyway, it works!! We fermented with a blend of English and Belgian yeast strains that seemed to work quite well together fermenting down to 4 plato in short order (that's 13.5% abv if you're counting).

A year has gone, but there's another to come, It's kept for us, and It's foolish & fun. So tuck yourself up, and hang on tight, There's a warm dark hold to sleep in tonight, And way at the bottom are grain, hops & yeast, Kept safe in this bottle from late summer's feast. From Pretty Things to you this winter season: 'Our Finest Regards'. Two years into our project and we're grateful and amazed that so many people love and support great beer these days. The fact that we're still here is a credit to you all. But for the question of primary importance: What is the beer? Well, It's our Pretty Things barleywine. Inspired by malted barley, a tribute to the barleycorn. Yes, It's simple, but that's what barleywines are all about. Ever since brewing in England, Dann has dreamed of making a barley-focused beer using the malts of Yorkshire (and never hesitates to plug his favorite: Thomas Fawcett & Sons). Give barley a chance and this mysterious little grain can do grand things! To get the density of sugars needed for this sort of beer, we employed 'double mashing'. The brewhouse that we work on can only get to maybe 18 plato for a single running of wort: but we wanted 27 plato!

Thank you to Breeze In, Juneau AK for getting your first Southern Tier beer on Growler fill or at least for as long as I have lived in Juneau. This was poured into a chalice. The appearance was a semi - dark red to brown color with what starts off as a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. There was some light lacing that tried to stick to the sides of the glass but slides at a decent rate. The smell had a decent caramel and toffee blend of malts. It wants to show a sweetness but comes across with a fair amount of vanilla. There's even a light nuttiness. Ah, finally, there's the oakiness, damn, that took a long time to come out. The taste was pretty much exactly the same way I described the nose and in the same order. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with just a tad of sessionability about it. Sessionability? In a Barleywine, hmmmm...I'm wondering how old is this? Overall, uh...okay, so I'm not getting any hoppiness from an American Barleywine and there's not any of the normal 'tobacco' aroma from an English Barleywine. Though this was just put on tap today, how old is this? I guess It's a decent perhaps 'aged' Barleywine depending upon when this really came out. I stand on the fence until further notice. "

A: Pours a clear copper color. The head is a one finger pale yellow shade. Not only is the retention good, but it leaves behind some nice rings of lacing. S: The hops here seem to be more citrusy than piny. I even want to say they're kind of berry-forward, suggesting this has Mosaic hops. Caramel and toffee malts are present, but thankfully are subdued. Actually, subdued is a good way to describe the general aroma; still decent, though. T: Holy crap, where did all this blueberry flavor come from? And not the pure Fruity Pebbles you get in, say, Leinenkugel Sunset Wheat, but actual friggen' blueberries. This note hits the palate immediately and I love it. There's no way this isn't brewed with Mosaic - as well as this brew shows off the berry notes, how can't it be? It finishes with some more piny hop flavors, caramel, toffee, and a twinge of alcohol. Just an all-around excellent barleywine. M: This is relatively light and crisp (for the style), yet still retains well-concealed alcohol. It's not overly dry, either. It does an excellent job of covering up the 10%. O: I admit, when Bitter Valentine let me down, it made me take pause over this offering. I was dead wrong: this is freaking fantastic. There's just enough 'balance' to display the berry-forward goodness without overpowering the palate. One of my favorite hoppy barleywines to date. "

However, time is on barley wine's side and I have finally got around to seeing if my learned offsider Bartlett's imprecation that this is worth its weight in salt is accurate. I shouldn't have been surprised at how dark this ale was, being more or less impenetrable by light. It carried no head at all. The aroma was overwhelmingly roasty with maybe a lick of dark fruit and nut chocolate and oakiness. The flavour is more or less replicated from the aroma with distinctly rich charriness and maybe this is where moist tobacco is lurking. There's a touch of spice and molasses toward a good finish. Is that all? Well, no it isn't. I'm pondering what makes a barley wine a barley wine. This is darker than such, but probably falls well outside what an Imperial Russian Stout is. It has a rye component, but this by no means excludes it from such a designation. I appreciate this beer as being a boundary pusher, but it a category dominated by giants, it is probably at best merely good. Needless to say, this isn't fair. "

Clearly these are not good to age. It's too dry, too sour, too woody. "

Pours black with a quickly dissipating head. Aroma is up front with a very recognizable coffee component from the regular Breakfast Stout - really earthy and fruity at the same time. Chocolate and caramel from the malts come to show. There is also a tinge from the barrel which gives the beer a wild side to it; the dissipating head and the acrid carbonation both give a nutch that there might not only be ale yeast in this. The 'wildness' from the barrel does however fit in very nicely with the coffee and chocolatey notes - and it gives a strong resemblance to red wine. The taste has a light tartness to it, which I guess has something to do with the barrel aging. But the tartness does not take away the focus from the marvellous base beer - it still has the most gorgeous coffee integration on a really nice and chocolate-like sweet (although far from TOO sweet) malt profile. The carbonation is excessive, especially considering the base beer - which leads me to believe that the barrel might have contained contaminants. But - once again, Kernel's Breakfast Stout appears as a crazily balanced and well-crafted beer; although the barrel aging and implementation of a minor degree of wild yeast doesn't make the beer any better.

Black, oily body, with a small, creamy, coffee colored head. Aroma of bourbon, coconut, vanilla, coffee, cocoa, wood, liquorice, some tobacco, some alcohol. Wonderful, balanced, quite dry taste of bourbon, coffee, cocoa, coconut, liquorice, tobacco, booze. Full, oily mouthfeel, with a soft carbonation. Finishes roasty, dry, quite alcoholic, a bit astringent, with coffee, dry cocoa, liquorice, some tobacco. Very tasty. The bourbon isn't too dominant, very well integrated. Quite strong and dry, with wonderful coffee and tobacco notes, but really smooth at the same time. Although I like the regular Brunch Weasel better, this is also delicious. "

Extremely dark burgundy colour, not to say pitch black, with a thin but densely structured, moussy, deep beige head retaining well around the edges. The aroma is divine and litterally makes my mouth water in seconds: a ton of mocha ice cream, sweet and perfumey vanilla, rich warm chocolate sauce, sweetish bourbon, cold espresso, bayleaf, hint of candied cherries, wet leather, dried plums, cinnamon, baker's chocolate, banana liqueur, cloves, cream, noble oak, soy sauce, exotic pepper, expensive Cuban cigars, veal stock. Flabbergastering flavour: there are some candied fruits in the onset, brown candi syrup even, but countered by an immediate, yet 'friendly' drought, sourish but not too much, very soft carbo resulting in a thick, fat, 'coating' mouthfeel the way any imperial stout should have, after which I am plunged into an abyss of creaminess, 'chocolateness' and caramel in its purest, most enticing form, leaving a thick layer of bittersweet maltiness - and an impression of pure and simple awe. Finishes in persisting creamy maltiness, the creamy feeling clearly achieved by the oatmeal, along with a delicate roasted coffee bean bitterness, a deep but noble, peppery hops presence, remaining candi syrup sweetness which somehow manages to avoid cloyingness, and of course the expected drying wood tannins as well as bourbon-like alcohol; both remain noble and restrained, rounding off the finish in the most gentle, aristocratic way. A creamy, oily coating sticks to the mouth cavity after swallowing. This is an imperial stout the way I like them most: every component is in perfect balance with the overall flavour profile, thus forming a dense, coherent whole. There is no sticky sugariness after swallowing, the added bourbon does not result in astringent alcohol, there are no shoe polish, varnish, glue or otherwise 'chemical' components in the aroma and there is enough drought to perfectly balance the big, creamy malt sweetness. Undoubtedly a world class masterpiece, not even exagerratedly expensive considering its quality, at least in comparison with some of the over-hyped American examples of the style. Truly majestic and certainly among the best barrel-aged stouts I had so far. "
